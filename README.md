## NeRF in Keras JAX

In this repository, we present a minimal JAX implementation of the research paper
[**NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)
by Ben Mildenhall et. al.

Here we do the following:
- Port the existing NeRF Keras tutorial from Keras-2 to Keras-3 âœ¨
- Utilise JAX as a backend in place of TensorFlow
- Achieve a 4X speed-up in training 
- Completely stateless API design

## Usage

To get started you can directly open the `nerf-keras-jax.ipynb` notebook or get started with `train.py`.
